_Grid Architect / Seniour Software Engineer / Project Manager_

I'm _Grid Architect_ at GridDynamics in San Francisco, USA. You can find me also in <a href="http://plus.google.com/109421189749606131821">Google+</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sotnikdv">LinkedIn</a>.

Officially I'm "Accomplished software engineer specializing in distributed and heavily loaded data processing systems, web services, clusters, databases and software architecture with more than 13 years experience.
Proven track record of designing and implementing solutions for distributed data processing in financial and e-commerce applications.
Extensive background in full life-cycle of software development process, from inception to support.
A competent and experienced project manager, with over 5 years experience in managing multi-disciplinary teams of varying sizes and complex programs of work."

In fact, from the beginning of my carrier I'm playing role of **researcher** and **troubleshooter**. For these 13 years I was Oracle DBA, Linux System Administrator, SCRUM Master, Security Specialist, Project Manager and business owner. All this experience makes me more flexible for a new challenges and helps me to look at the problem on many different layers.
The only constant thing in this professional evolving is a strict following to common sense and some degree of perfectionism.

Currently I'm exploring not extremely new, but rapidly growing Big Data area and involved in R&D in this field in parallel with my current activities, so I hope to become _Big Data Architect_ soon.
